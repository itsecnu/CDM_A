# CDM_A
# Is attention all that learners need? -Enhancing cognitive diagnosis method for intelligent adaptive learning
# As the advance of accelerating in various technologies, a multitude of novel applications are being integrated into the educational landscape. Intelligent learning systems that are particularly prominent application of AI and machine learning in education, aim to capture the mastery of learnerâ€™s knowledge and provide in person and online tutoring through real-time cognitive diagnosis. However, we have a limited understanding on what is the reality of attention mechanism for computer-supported cognitive diagnosis. Aiming at the issue that existing cognitive diagnostic models do not consider the interaction between student knowledge level and exercise item difficulty on student learning state diagnosis, a cognitive diagnostic method based on attention mechanism (CDM_A) is proposed yielding a better learning experience. Considering the impact of exercise items attributes on student learning state diagnosis, the problem discrimination vector and a weight Q-matrix for CDM_A are explored explicitly. Finally, much more endeavors have been made to verify the proposed CDM_A on the open dataset.
